# How to Unclog Your Toilet Before Calling a Plumber

A clogged toilet is one of the most common plumbing problems in Parisian homes. Before calling a professional plumber, here are some simple and effective solutions to try yourself.

## 1. The Plunger: Your First Ally

The plunger remains the most effective tool for unclogging toilets. Position it properly at the bottom of the bowl, create a tight seal, and perform vigorous back-and-forth movements. This technique works in 80% of light blockage cases.

## 2. Hot Water and Dish Soap

Pour a few tablespoons of dish soap into the bowl, then add very hot water (but not boiling to avoid damaging the porcelain). Let it sit for 15-20 minutes. The soap lubricates and helps dissolve fats.

## 3. Baking Soda and Vinegar

This natural solution is ideal for light blockages:
- Pour 200g of baking soda
- Add 250ml of white vinegar
- Let it foam for 30 minutes
- Rinse with hot water

## When to Call a Professional?

If the problem persists after these attempts, **don't force it** and contact a professional plumber. A persistent blockage may indicate:

- A deeper problem in the pipes
- A stuck object requiring specialized equipment
- An anomaly in your drainage system
