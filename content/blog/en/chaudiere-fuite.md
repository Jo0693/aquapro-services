# Why Is My Boiler Leaking? The 3 Most Common Causes

A boiler leak is never trivial. It can cause significant damage and compromise the efficiency of your heating system. Here are the three main causes we encounter most often during our interventions in Paris and Île-de-France.

## 1. Worn or Defective Seals

**The #1 cause of boiler leaks**

Over time and with temperature variations, sealing gaskets naturally degrade. The most sensitive areas are:

- Pipe connections
- Heat body
- Circulation pump
- Expansion vessel

**Solution:** Seal replacement is a quick and inexpensive intervention that must be performed by a professional. Expect between €80 and €150 depending on complexity.

## 2. Excessive Pressure in the Circuit

**A common and easily identifiable problem**

Your boiler has a pressure gauge that indicates the circuit pressure. Normal pressure is between 1 and 1.5 bar. Beyond 2.5 bar, your safety valve may activate and let water escape.

**Possible causes:**
- Faulty expansion vessel
- Excess water in the circuit
- Fill valve problem

**Solution:** Check your pressure gauge. If the pressure is too high, **do not attempt to drain yourself**: contact a qualified heating engineer. Improper handling can damage the system.

## 3. Corrosion and Natural Wear

**Time takes its toll**

A boiler has an average lifespan of 15 to 20 years. After this period, internal corrosion can cause leaks, particularly on:

- Cast iron or steel heat body
- Heat exchanger
- Connection pipes

**Warning signs:**
- Rust traces around the boiler
- Gradual performance decline
- Abnormal noises (clicks, whistles)
- Increased energy consumption

**Solution:** If your boiler is over 15 years old and shows signs of advanced corrosion, complete replacement may be more economical than repair. New condensing boilers offer efficiency over 95% and can reduce your energy bill by 30%.

## What to Do in Case of a Leak?

### Immediate actions:

1. **Cut the electrical supply** to the boiler
2. **Close the water supply** to the heating circuit
3. **Mop up the water** to avoid damage
4. **Contact a professional immediately**

⚠️ **Never attempt to repair a leaking boiler yourself.** Interventions on heating systems require specific skills and professional certification.

## The Importance of Annual Maintenance

Regular maintenance can detect and prevent 90% of boiler problems. During the mandatory annual visit, the heating engineer checks:

- Seal and connection condition
- Circuit pressure
- Expansion vessel condition
- Corrosion signs
- Proper operation of safety valve

**AquaPro Services** offers annual maintenance contracts for your boiler from €120/year, including intervention, complete cleaning, verification of all components, and compliance certificate.
