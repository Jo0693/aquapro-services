# Should You Service Your Water Heater Every Year?

Your water heater is one of the most heavily used appliances in your home, operating 24/7 to provide hot water. Yet many neglect its maintenance. Here's why regular servicing is essential and how it can save you money.

## Is Annual Maintenance Mandatory?

**For electric water heaters:** Annual maintenance is **not legally required**, but it is **strongly recommended** for performance, savings, and longevity reasons.

**For gas water heaters:** Annual maintenance is **mandatory** by law, just like gas boilers. An annual service certificate must be issued each year.

## 5 Reasons to Service Your Water Heater

### 1. Combat Limescale

In the Paris region, water is particularly hard. Limescale gradually accumulates:

- On the electric heating element
- At the bottom of the tank
- In the pipes

**Consequence:** A limescale layer of just 3mm can increase your electricity consumption by **15 to 20%**. Annual descaling can save up to â‚¬100/year on your electricity bill.

### 2. Extend Lifespan

A well-maintained water heater can last **15 to 20 years**, compared to only **8 to 10 years** without maintenance. The cost of annual servicing (â‚¬80-120) is largely offset by savings from avoiding premature replacement (â‚¬1500-3000).

### 3. Prevent Breakdowns

90% of water heater failures are due to limescale or malfunction detectable during preventive maintenance:

- Scaled or defective heating element
- Misadjusted thermostat
- Worn anode (anti-corrosion protection)
- Damaged flange seal

### 4. Optimize Performance

A serviced water heater heats faster and maintains temperature better, offering you:

- Hot water available more quickly
- Stable and comfortable temperature
- Reduced heating time (energy savings)

### 5. Ensure Safety

Servicing allows checking:

- Safety group (pressure relief valve)
- Electrical connections
- Tank condition (corrosion)
- Proper thermostat operation

A poorly maintained water heater can present risks of electrocution, overpressure, or significant leakage.

## What Servicing Frequency?
